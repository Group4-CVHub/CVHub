            <h3>How it all started </h3>
            <p>
                We are 4 students who studied Object Oriented Programming (OOP) at the Commercial Academy when we got the chance to do a project work. Since we all had our own experience of how difficult it is to get a job and thus know the importance of having a good CV to get a job, therefore we have decided to program a free page where you can easily find an already completed CV.
            </p>

            <h4>For us is a simple path to a good CV is most important</h4>
            <p>We want our users to have it as easy as possible to get a ready-made template to be able to create as good a CV as possible without being charged anything per month</p>
